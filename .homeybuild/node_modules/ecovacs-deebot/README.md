Library for running Ecovacs Deebot vacuum cleaner robots

## Installation

Information on how to install this library can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js/wiki/Installation).

The minimum required version is 12.x.

## Usage

Information on how to use this library can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js/wiki/Usage).

## Models

### Supported models

* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot OZMO 930
* Deebot OZMO 920/950

The models listed are those that I have in use myself or which are technically identical to these.

### These models should work properly or at least partially

* Deebot Slim 2
* Deebot N79 series
* Deebot M88
* Deebot 500
* Deebot 600/601/605
* Deebot 710/711
* Deebot OZMO 610
* Deebot OZMO 900/905
* Deebot OZMO Slim 10/11
* Deebot U2 series
* Deebot N3 MAX
* Deebot N7
* Deebot N8 series
* Deebot OZMO T5
* Deebot (OZMO) T8 series
* Deebot T9 series

The models listed are either already known to work or are technically similar to these models.
Nevertheless, the functionality may be partially limited.

I try to achieve a wide range of functionality, but decide this case by case depending on complexity and various other criteria.
There is of course no claim to full functionality.

## Known issues

* The generation of map images is currently not stable on 32-bit systems
* The cleaning log has an empty result on T9 series
* The combined map data object does not work with T9 series
* TrueDetect commands not working yet (tested on T9)
* "Edge" command does not work with Deebot U2 (starts auto clean instead)
